# ADM/ADSM workspace

Sets up a VS Code dev-container containing ADM and ADSM tools so that you can work on creating ADM or ADSM models. It also clones the ADDB [repo](https://github.com/securitydesign/addb) to `/usr/share/addb`. Remember to use this path for `addb:` field in your ADSM files.

## Usage

Make a copy of this repository into a new project directory. If you have existing ADM or ADSM, copy them into the project directory before launching it.
